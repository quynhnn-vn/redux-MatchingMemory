# React Redux Project: Matching Memory

Build a classic matching game:
- Create a grid of 12 cards
- Flip each card to find a pair with the same content
- Show the matched cards found
- Hide the cards that don't match

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
